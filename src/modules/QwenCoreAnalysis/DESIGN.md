# CoreAnalysis Module Architecture

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive static code analysis system for identifying code quality issues, maintainability concerns, and refactoring opportunities.

## Core Components

### 1. BaseAnalyzer
Abstract base class that all analyzers extend.
- Provides common functionality for file traversal
- Defines interface for analysis methods
- Handles result aggregation

### 2. Specific Analyzers
- **LineCountAnalyzer**: Identifies files above configurable line count thresholds
- **ComplexityAnalyzer**: Calculates cyclomatic complexity for functions
- **FunctionSizeAnalyzer**: Finds functions that exceed length thresholds
- **CodeSmellDetector**: Identifies TODOs, FIXMEs, and other markers
- **NestingAnalyzer**: Finds deeply nested code blocks
- **ModuleAnalyzer**: Evaluates file structure and modularization

### 3. Configuration System
- JSON-based configuration
- Configurable thresholds for all metrics
- File inclusion/exclusion patterns

### 4. Report Generator
- Generates detailed markdown reports
- Creates prioritized action items
- Produces summary dashboards

## Data Flow
1. Configuration is loaded
2. File discovery based on patterns
3. Each analyzer processes relevant files
4. Results are aggregated and scored
5. Reports are generated in multiple formats

## Extensibility
- New analyzers can be added by extending BaseAnalyzer
- Custom reporters can be implemented
- Configuration can be extended for new metrics
