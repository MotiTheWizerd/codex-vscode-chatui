# Renderer Module

## Overview

The renderer module was planned but is not currently implemented as a separate module. The rendering logic is handled directly in the webview's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `media/chat` directory.

## Implementation Status

Not implemented as a separate TypeScript module. Rendering logic is implemented in the webview's frontend code.

## Current Implementation

The rendering logic is implemented in:
- `media/chat/index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `media/chat/styles/` - CSS stylesheets for styling and layout
- `media/chat/js/` - JavaScript files for dynamic behavior and rendering
- `media/chat/html/` - HTML fragments for modular UI components

## Planned Features (Historical)

The original plan included:
- Message rendering with proper formatting
- User input rendering and handling
- Theme support for different VS Code themes
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Design Principles

1. **Performance**: Optimizes rendering for smooth user experience
2. **Consistency**: Maintains consistent appearance with VS Code
3. **Flexibility**: Supports different message types and formatting
4. **Maintainability**: Separates rendering logic from business logic (in webview code)

## Future Considerations

If implemented as a separate module, it would:
- Handle message rendering with proper formatting
- Manage user input rendering and handling
- Provide theme support for different VS Code themes
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Separate rendering logic from business logic for better maintainability
