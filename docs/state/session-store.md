## Overview

The session store module manages persistent storage of session data for the Codex extension. It handles saving and retrieving chat sessions, conversation history, and other session-specific data.

## Implementation Status

This module is planned but not yet implemented. It will provide persistent storage for session data.

## Planned Features

- Storage and retrieval of chat sessions
- Management of conversation history
- Session persistence across VS Code restarts
- Data migration between versions

## Design Principles

1. **Persistence**: Ensures session data survives VS Code restarts
2. **Performance**: Optimizes storage and retrieval operations
3. **Migration**: Supports data migration between versions
4. **Scalability**: Handles growing amounts of session data efficiently
