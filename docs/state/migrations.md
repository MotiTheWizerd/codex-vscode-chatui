# Migrations Module

## Overview

The migrations module handles data migration between different versions of the Codex extension. It ensures that stored data remains compatible as the extension evolves.

## Implementation Status

This module is planned but not yet implemented. It will manage schema and data migrations as the extension evolves.

## Planned Features

- Version tracking for stored data
- Automated migration of data between versions
- Backward compatibility support
- Rollback capabilities for failed migrations

## Design Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures older data can be read by newer versions
2. **Automated Migrations**: Minimizes manual intervention required for updates
3. **Safe Operations**: Provides rollback capabilities for failed migrations
4. **Version Tracking**: Maintains clear version information for stored data
