# Settings Module

## Overview

The settings module handles user and workspace configuration for the Codex extension. It provides utilities for reading and writing VS Code settings.

## Implementation Status

This module is planned but not yet implemented. It will integrate with VS Code's configuration API to read user settings and provide a consistent interface for accessing configuration values.

## Planned Features

- Read user/workspace settings from VS Code
- Provide typed access to configuration values
- Support for updating settings programmatically
- Validation of configuration values

## Design Principles

1. **VS Code Integration**: Leverages VS Code's built-in configuration system
2. **Type Safety**: Provides typed access to configuration values
3. **Validation**: Includes validation for configuration values
4. **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended with new configuration options
