# Secrets Module

## Overview

The secrets module handles secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information such as API keys and authentication tokens. It provides a secure interface for managing secrets that should not be stored in plain text.

## Implementation Status

This module is planned but not yet implemented. It will integrate with VS Code's secret storage API to securely store sensitive information.

## Planned Features

- Secure storage of API keys and authentication tokens
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Access control for secrets
- Integration with VS Code's secret storage API

## Design Principles

1. **Security First**: Ensures sensitive data is never stored in plain text
2. **VS Code Integration**: Leverages VS Code's built-in secret storage capabilities
3. **Access Control**: Provides controlled access to secrets
4. **Transparency**: Clear API for requesting and using secrets
