## Planned Features

- Multiple log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Structured logging with metadata
- Configurable log output (console, file, remote service)
- Performance-optimized logging

## Design Principles

1. **Structured Logging**: Uses structured data for better analysis
2. **Configurable Output**: Supports multiple output destinations
3. **Performance**: Minimizes performance impact of logging
4. **Consistency**: Provides consistent logging interface across the application
