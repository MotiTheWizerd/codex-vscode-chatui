# Metrics Module

## Overview

The metrics module collects and manages usage metrics and performance data for the Codex extension. It provides insights into how the extension is being used and how it performs.

## Implementation Status

This module is planned but not yet implemented. It will collect various metrics about extension usage and performance.

## Planned Features

- Collection of usage metrics (feature usage, user interactions)
- Performance metrics (response times, memory usage)
- Aggregation of metrics data
- Periodic reporting of metrics

## Design Principles

1. **Privacy Conscious**: Collects only necessary metrics without compromising user privacy
2. **Performance**: Minimizes performance impact of metrics collection
3. **Configurable**: Allows users to control what metrics are collected
4. **Aggregate Data**: Focuses on aggregate data rather than individual user data
