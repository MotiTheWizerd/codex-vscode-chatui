# Codebase Analysis for AI Agents

This directory contains structured JSON files that provide detailed analysis of the codebase for AI agents to understand the project structure, symbols, and content.

## Files

1. **codebase-structure.json** - High-level architecture, dependencies, and relationships for architectural queries.
2. **codebase-symbols.json** - Detailed symbol information for code understanding and API queries.
3. **codebase-content.json** - Source code snippets for implementation details and code review.

## Usage

To regenerate these files, run:

```bash
npm run generate-docs
```

## Semantic Search Query Mapping

### Architecture Questions → codebase-structure.json
- "What does CoreManager do?"
- "How are components connected?"
- "What design patterns are used?"
- "What are the main layers?"

### API/Interface Questions → codebase-symbols.json
- "What methods does CoreManager have?"
- "What properties does ChatMessage have?"
- "How do I use the EventBus?"
- "What parameters does activate take?"

### Implementation Questions → codebase-content.json
- "How is error handling implemented?"
- "Show me the CoreManager constructor"
- "What's the actual code for event emission?"
- "How are resources disposed?"

## File Structure

- `codebase-structure.json` - Contains metadata, architecture layers, dependencies, patterns, and hotspots
- `codebase-symbols.json` - Contains detailed information about classes, interfaces, functions, enums, and types
- `codebase-content.json` - Contains file information, key sections, and code snippets

These files are automatically generated by the `scripts/generate-codebase-json.cjs` script.
